    <string name="alex_about">Hey guys, Alex here, better known as @themacrobarista on
        Instagram! It’s a known fact that there are tons of calories packed into the things
        we eat and drink every day. When I realized that the coffee I was drinking was loaded with sugar,
        I decided to do something about it…\n\n\n
        Over the last two years, I’ve made it my mission to put in the time and research to create more than
        100 macro-friendly coffee recipes! The best way to bring you the pictures is through my Instagram page.
        That being said, it became apparent that there was another, more user friendly way I could provide value to you.\n\n\n
        I wanted to find a way for you to Be Your Own Barista, create your own drinks, and have an organized database for all
        of your favorite recipes!\n\n\nSo without further adieu, I want to welcome you to your very own app dedicated to help
        find you the perfect drink, or even create your own! I encourage you to be creative with the tools I’m giving you! Use
        this platform to your advantage, good luck, and BYOB!
